# Portfolio-Generator

This is a portfolio generator application. The user is prompted to fill out
a questionare related to coding projects that the user has created. Upon filling
out the entire questionare, an HTML page will be created that displays the answers
the user provided to create the application. Using JavaScript along with Node, the user will now have a portfolio HTML page that uses Bootsrap CSS design! In order to use this application, the user cannot go to Github pages to find a deployed site. Instead, the user must clone this code to their machine and run node + the index.html file path in order to start the questionare and create their portfolio page.
